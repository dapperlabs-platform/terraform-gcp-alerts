# GCP Alerts

## What does this do?

This creates log based alerts in GCP. You can create a log based filter to alert when a certain log condition is met and have it communicate to a PagerDuty alert channel.

## How to provision this module?

To create the module it is required to set values for the following variables:
    * alerts
    * project
    * enabled
    * pd_service_key

### Example of How to Set up the Module
```hcl
module "alerts" {
  source = "github.com/dapperlabs-platform/terraform-gcp-alerts?ref=[VERSION]"

  alerts         = local.alerts           // This is a local variable that defines the alerts
  project        = var.project            // The name of the GCP project where these alerts will be provisioned
  enabled        = false                  // This is recommended when initializing an alert as it will not trigger a real PagerDuty event.
  pd_service_key = var.pd_service_key     // The Integration Key for the PagerDuty service you wish to alert
}
```

### Example of Alert definition
```hcl
locals {
  alerts = {
    // Someone tries to destroy a key
    "Key Deleted" = {
      "filter" = "protoPayload.authorizationInfo.permission=\"cloudkms.cryptoKeyVersions.destroy\""
      "label_extractors" = {
        "Email"       = "protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail"
        "Key_Version" = "protoPayload.resourceName"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
